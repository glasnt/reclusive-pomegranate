# Quotation

> One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing
> to do with it -- it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For
> the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat,
> for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well,
> considering) so you see that it couldn't have had any hand in
> the mischief.
